# Notes app made using flask 
This is my first endevour into web development. I coded this in python using the flask framework by following every second of [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI) I hope to use the knowledge I gained from here to create my own useful web app in the near future.

# App features:
1) User account management and login
2) Ability to save, add and delete notes
3) Stores user data on a local database
4) Encrypts user password when account is created to protect data during breaches and to add security.
